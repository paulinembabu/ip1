        <P> Growing up, I have always had an interest
        in music. I can listen to any gener of music as long as the song has a message behind it and the beats
        are supper cool. Often i work while listening to music escepially if in the afternoon since music just takes
        me to another level of concetration and understanding</P><br>

        <p>  There is always something about art that
        always draws me to it. i can help but stare or just take a photo.
        Good art alawys has some message behind it and you only get to understand it when you connect with the
        artist. </p>
         
        <p> Generally am just an ambitious young lady. main goal in life being to be one of the best women in tech and work for a world class company
        like microsoft. and this is why i joined Moringa school for it is the place to grow and become who you want to be.

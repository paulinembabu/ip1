            when i cleared my kenya secondary school examination and i passed and joined   a good univeristy.
            For my campus eduction i chose to study bsc in computer science from the interest i had developed ealier
            before i had joined campus.I did a couple of school projects and i also  got to represent the university
            in challenges that were about tech.</p><br>

          <img src="music.jpg"alt="Events."style="width:400px;height:150px;"/> <P> Growing up, I have always had an interest
          in music. I can listen to any gener of music as long as the song has a message behind it and the beats
        are supper cool. Often i work while listening to music escepially if in the afternoon since music just takes
      me to another level of concetration and understanding</P><br></div>

        <img src="art.jpg"alt="Events."style="width:400px;height:150px;"/><p>  There is always something about art that
          always draws me to it. i can help but stare or just take a photo.
          Good art alawys has some message behind it and you only get to understand it when you connect with the
          artist. </p>
